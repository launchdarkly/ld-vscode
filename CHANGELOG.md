# Change Log

All notable changes to the "launchdarkly" extension will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.3] - 2018-11-26

### Fixed

- The previous version of ld-vscode had shipped with a potentially vulnerable version of `event-stream`, a dependency used by the vscode api. This version downgrades `event-stream` to a previous version that did not contain this vulnerability. More information on this vulnerability can be found here: https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116.
