# Change Log

All notable changes to the "launchdarkly" extension will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.1] - 2020-02-21

### Added

- The hover display surfaces the feature flag's name

## [2.2.0] - 2020-01-06

### Added

- The extension now contributes a `LaunchDarkly: Configure` command to configure or reconfigure the extension. The extension will prompt users to configure on installation or update, or on obsolete configurations (see Changed section)

### Changed

- It is now possible to configure the extension without storing secrets in `settings.json`. Use the `LaunchDarkly: Configure` command to configure the extension. With this change, the `accessToken` configuration option is now deprecated, and will be automatically cleared when the `LaunchDarkly: Configure` is ran and completed.
- The `sdkKey` configuration option is now obsolete. The SDK key will now be inferred from the configured project and environment.

## [2.1.2] - 2019-12-26

## [2.0.3] - 2018-11-26

### Fixed

- The previous version of ld-vscode had shipped with a potentially vulnerable version of `event-stream`, a dependency used by the vscode api.

### Removed
