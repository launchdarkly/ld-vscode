### Hover
Show LaunchDarkly feature flag information right in your code. Anywhere a feature flag key is wrapped in string delimiters or if your application leverages [Code References](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/code/code-references) you can find aliases throughout the code base and a informational hover will appear when you mouseover them.

### Feature Flag Explorer
The feature flag explorer will automatically refresh whenever environment-specific configuration updates are made, like turning on your flag or adding a rule. For any changes that affect all environments, such as adding tags, the explorer can be manually refreshed.

New flags will automatically be added to the end of the feature flag list until next reload of the application.

Flag names in the treeview can be right-clicked where you can update a flag's state, default rule when on, and default off variation

### Flag Lens
The Flag Lens functionality shows insights about the usage and status of LaunchDarkly feature flags directly in the code. For a given feature flag in the codebase, the Flags Lens displays:

__Flag Name__: The unique identifier for the feature flag within LaunchDarkly.
__Flag Status__: Whether the flag is currently turned on or off.
__Variation Information__: Which variation or value of the flag is currently being served.

This is OFF by default. It can be enabled through Settings > LaunchDarkly Extension > Enable Flag Lens.
