### Hover
Show LaunchDarkly feature flag information right in your code. Anywhere a feature flag key is wrapped in string delimiters or if your application leverages [Code References](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/code/code-references) you can find aliases throughout the code base and a informational hover will appear when you mouseover them.

### Feature Flag Explorer
The feature flag explorer will automatically refresh whenever environment-specific configuration updates are made, like turning on your flag or adding a rule. For any changes that affect all environments, such as adding tags, the explorer can be manually refreshed.

New flags will automatically be added to the end of the feature flag list until next reload of the application.
