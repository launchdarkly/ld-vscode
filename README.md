## Features

- Feature flag details tooltip on hover
- Flag name autocomplete
- Open feature flags in LaunchDarkly (Default keybind: `ctrl+alt+g`/`âŒ˜+alt+g`)
- Feature flag explorer: view a list of your feature flags and their settings in the explorer view

The feature flag explorer will automatically refresh whenever environment-specific configuration updates are made, like turning on your flag or adding a rule. For any changes that affect all environments, such as adding tags, the explorer can be manually refreshed.
