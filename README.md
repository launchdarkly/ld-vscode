## Development

### TypeScript

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). There is
excellent editor support for it, so hopefully jumping in should be a little
easier thanks to IntelliSenseâ„¢.

We rely on [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting. See their docs on details for running `prettier` automatically from your editor. If you're using WebStorm, you'll need to format manually for now:

```
$ yarn pretty
```

If you use VSCode, then you can add this to your workspace settings to format on save:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.singleQuote": true,
  "prettier.useTabs": true,
  "prettier.trailingComma": "all",
  "prettier.printWidth": 80
}
```
